actually, I am very frustrated due to your feedback as I tried hard to prove all I have and worked on the project for many days and many hours and finally, you think that I plagiarized this project from the source you have provided please note that I already have no access on the source which you think I copied it which prove that I didn't copy it at all as when I'm trying to enter to this like I was redirected to the following link https://review.udacity.com/#!/forbidden
which means I have no access and I Unauthorized user 
so how come I coped the code 

I just hoped to review my code fairly and give some advice if you have technical suggestions to improve the code 

moreover, I left some comments within the files you've posted to explain the logic of my code
